Password  Authentication using Associative Neural Memory  Model(HPNN)
They are many ways of providing security to user resources. 
Password authentication is a very important system  security  procedure  to  secure  user  resources.
Traditional password  authentication have several probems to solve that , we have been introduced  to  
provide  password  authentication  using Associative Memories 
like Hopfield Neural Network(HPNN),Bidirectional  Associative  Memories(BA
M),Brain-State-in-a  Box(BSB).in this i have used HPNN Techniqe for Password Autentication.
i have uploaded complete project file,i have executed in matlab.   

steps:
The password authentication using Hopfield method may use any one of the Textual or Graphical 
password  as  password  and  can  train  network  so  that it  can  authenticate  users

This  scheme reads colour of each pixel of the selected image and converts the colour into red, green and blue 
(RGB) parts as any colour can be produced using the se three primary colours 

Converting image in to bipolar values
